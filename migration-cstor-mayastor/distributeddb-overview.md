# Migration from CStor to Mayastor for Distributed Databases (Cassandra)


This documentation outlines the process of migrating application volumes from CStor to Mayastor. We will leverage Velero for backup and restoration, facilitating the transition from a CStor cluster to a Mayastor cluster. This example specifically focuses on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.

**Velero Support**: Velero supports the backup and restoration of Kubernetes volumes attached to pods through File System Backup (FSB) or Pod Volume Backup. This process involves using modules from popular open-source backup tools like Restic (which we will utilize).

- For **cloud provider plugins**, refer to the [Velero Docs - Providers section](https://velero.io/docs/main/supported-providers/).
- **Velero GKE Configuration (Prerequisites)**: You can find the prerequisites and configuration details for Velero in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) environment on the GitHub [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp#setup).
- **Object Storage Requirement**: To store backups, Velero necessitates an object storage bucket. In our case, we utilize a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. Configuration details and setup can be found on the GitHub [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp#setup). 
- **Velero Basic Installation**: For a step-by-step guide on the basic installation of Velero, refer to the [Velero Docs - Basic Install section](https://velero.io/docs/v1.11/basic-install/).
