## Supportability

The supportability tool collects Mayastor specific information from the cluster using the [kubectl plugin](https://mayastor.gitbook.io/introduction/reference/kubectl-plugin) command-line tool. It uses the dump command, which interacts with the Mayastor services to build an archive (ZIP) file that acts as a placeholder for the bundled information.


### Using the supportability tool

To bundle Mayastor's complete system information, execute:

{% tab title="Command" %}
```text
kubectl mayastor dump system -n mayastor -d <output_directory_path>
```
{% endtab %}

To view all the available options and sub-commands that can be used with the dump command, execute:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Command" %}
```text
kubectl mayastor dump --help
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Sample Output" %}
```text
kubectl-mayastor-dump 
`Dump` resources

## Does the supportability tool expose sensitive data?

The supportability tool generates support bundles, which are used for debugging purposes. These bundles are created in response to the user's invocation of the tool and can be transmitted only by the user.
Below is the information collected by the supportability tool that might be identified as 'sensitive' based on the organization's data protection/privacy commitments and security policies.
**Logs:**
The default installation of Mayastor includes the deployment of a log aggregation subsystem based on Grafana Loki. All the pods deployed in the same namespace as Mayastor and labelled with `openebs.io/logging=true` will have their logs incorporated within this centralized collector. These logs may include the following information:
- Kubernetes (K8s) node hostnames
- IP addresses
    - container addresses
- API endpoints
    - Mayastor
    - K8s
- Container names
- K8s Persistent Volume names (provisioned by Mayastor)
- DiskPool names
- Block device details (except the content)
 **K8s Definition Files:**
 The support bundle includes definition files for all the Mayastor components. Some of these are listed below:
- Deployments
- DaemonSets
- StatefulSets

**K8s Events:**
The archive files generated by the supportability tool contain information on all the events of the Kubernetes cluster present in the same namespace as Mayastor.

**etcd Dump:**
The default installation of Mayastor deploys an etcd instance for its exclusive use. This key-value pair is used to persist state information for Mayastor-managed objects. These key-value pairs are required for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes. The etcd dump archive file consists of the following information:
- Kubernetes node hostnames
- IP addresses
- PVC/PV names
- Container names
    - Mayastor
    - User applications within the mayastor namespace
- Block device details (except data content)

{% hint style="info" %}
<b>Note:</b>The list provided above is frequently reviewed and updated by the Mayastor maintainers. However, it might not be fully exhaustive, given that "sensitive information" is a subjective term.
